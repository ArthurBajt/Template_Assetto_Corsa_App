## A Template folder and script for Assetto Corsa Python app



I'm trying to make App developpent in Assetto Corsa easier.
So here's a template folder , and a script that already include :
* __SimInfo__ (for 32 & 64 bits) *by Rombik , modified by me*
* An __acMain()__ function
    * that already create an App window
    * is link to an OpenGL render function : __appGL()__
